The Cultural Factors
The DIYS.com study defined a city's 'culture' as the number of cultural factors it had. The study defined only 6 cultural factors: art galleries, art museums, theatres, independent cinemas, libraries and Michelin star restaurants. I have some issues with this definition of culture. It feels very narrow and weighted towards the arts. While art galleries and art museums are counted as distinct factors, no other types of museum are included. Also missing are factors such as festivals, nightclubs, music halls.
